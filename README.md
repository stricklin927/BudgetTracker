MSU - Homework 18: Budget Tracker (PWA, Online-Offline)

## Overview
For this project I created a budget tracker application that allows for offline access and functionality.
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. After entering transactions offline, the populate will then total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:
  * Enter deposits offline
  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:
  * Offline entries are added to tracker.

## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
